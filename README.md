# Pomodoro-Clock
FreeCodeCamp Pomodoro assignment


Pomodoro, or Tomato Timers, clocks are used to break work into intervals. Traditionally, it was usually set to about 25min of work and a shorter, 3-5min, break. After so many intervals, a longer break is taken. 
This version allows you to set the work and break time. Either use the buttons within the field to adjust the numbers or type them in. As soon as the "start" button is pressed, the work timer will being. If you click anywhere in the field while the timer is going, it will pause, click again to resume. 
The Reset button will return the page to its original self.
